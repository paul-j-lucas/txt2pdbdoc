* Changes in txt2pdbdoc 1.6

** Added support for transcoding between PalmOS and Unicode.
Text documents to be encoded to Doc can now be in UTF-8.  The Unicode
codepoints are now automatically transcoded into the PalmOS character set that
is simiar to but slightly different from both ISO 8859-1 and Windows-1252.
Simiarly, Doc files that are decoded are now automatically transcoded back to
UTF-8.

When transcoding of a particular character is impossible (because there is no
equivalent in the other character set), a warning is printed.

** Added pdbdump command.
A separate command, pdbdump, can be used to dump the raw data of a PDB file.

* Changes in txt2pdbdoc 1.5

** Added time-stamp suppression option.
txt2pdbdoc now has a -t option to suppress using the current time-stamp in
generated PDB files.  (This was necessary for testing since two PDB files with
equal content but different time-stamps would never compare equal on a
byte-by-byte level.)

** Better option checking.
txt2pdbdoc is now more robust about checking command-line options (options that
either forbid or require other options).

** Resurrected pdb.4 manual page.
Since Palm information is hard to find nowadays, the pdb.4 manual page has been
resurrected.

* Changes in txt2pdbdoc 1.4.4

** Added type/creator checking suppression option.
txt2pdbdoc now has a -D option to suppress checking of a Doc file's
type/creator.

** Fixed a small bug in printing an error message.
