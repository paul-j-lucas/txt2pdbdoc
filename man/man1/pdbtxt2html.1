.B pdbtxt2html \-v
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pdbtxt2html
converts text converted from a
.BR Doc (4)
file via
.BR txt2pdbdoc (1)
to HTML.
If no HTML filename is given, the generated HTML is sent to standard output.
.SS Document Title
The first line of the file is used for the HTML document title.
.SS Bookmarks
The last line of the file is examined and, if it contains a string enclosed
between \f(CW<\f1 and \f(CW>\f1, that is taken to be the bookmark marker.
The entire file is then scanned looking for lines beginning with it
(ignoring leading whitespace).
These lines are converted to HTML headings.
.PP
The number of whitespace characters after the first bookmark marker
is used for heading level 1.
The level of subsequent headings is set to the number of whitespace
characters between the bookmark marker and the bookmark text
minus the number for the first bookmark plus one.
.SS Embedded URLs
Valid URLs (according to RFC 1630) embedded in the text
are turned into hyperlinks.
