.SH DESCRIPTION
The PDB (Pilot Database) file format is used by all models
of Palm Pilots and IBM Workpad.
The format consists of a header followed by a set of record headers
followed by the records themselves.
.SS Word Sizes
In the synopsis above, the types
\f(CWByte\f1,
\f(CWWord\f1, and \f(CWDWord\f1
are used just as in the Pilot headers.
The type \f(CWByte\f1 is 8 bits;
\f(CWWord\f1 is 16 bits;
\f(CWDWord\f1 is 32 bits.
The latter two are in big-endian format.
.SH CAVEAT
The C structures given in the synopsis above are illustrative
and may not work in actual C code
since compilers align data members on word boundaries.
