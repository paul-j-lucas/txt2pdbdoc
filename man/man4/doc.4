.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B Doc
file format is the standard text document format
used by all models of the Palm Pilot.
A
.B Doc
file is a
.BR pdb (4)
file: this manual page describes only those aspects specific to
.B Doc
files.
.PP
A
.B Doc
file consists of 0 to \f(CWnum_recs\f1 records;
record 0 is the header for the document.
(This header is distinct from the
.BR pdb (4)
header.)
The remaining records contain text,
either plain or compressed depending upon \f(CWversion\f1.
.SS Word Sizes
In the synopsis above, the types \f(CWWord\f1 and \f(CWDWord\f1
are used just as in the Pilot headers.
The type \f(CWWord\f1 is 16 bits;
the type \f(CWDWord\f1 is 32 bits.
Both are in big-endian format.
.SS Compression Format
A character ``\f(CWc\f1'' in a compressed record is in one of four classes:
.TP 10
\f(CW01-08\f1
Copy ``\f(CWc\f1'' bytes
.TP
\f(CW00,09-7F\f1
Self
.TP
\f(CW80-BF\f1
Sequence
.TP
\f(CWC0-FF\f1
A space plus the ASCII character \f(CWc ^ 0x80\f1
